Overview
Stock market prediction is a complex task due to the nonlinear and high-dimensional nature of financial data. Classical machine learning models often fall short in capturing these patterns, especially for high-frequency data. This project leverages QNNs, harnessing quantum mechanics principles to better model and predict price movement trends based on daily NASDAQ stock data.

Project Features
QNN-based model: Employs Quantum Neural Networks to predict whether the stock price will rise or fall.
PennyLane Framework: Uses PennyLane for quantum circuit implementation, supporting both quantum and classical computation.
Optimization with COBYLA: The COBYLA algorithm is used for training, which is well-suited for handling non-differentiable objective functions in quantum circuits.
Evaluation Metrics: Assesses model performance using accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.
Data
The dataset consists of NASDAQ daily stock prices, including:

Open and Close Prices: Used to calculate the price direction (up or down) for each day.
High and Low Prices: Included as additional features to improve the modelâ€™s predictive capacity.
Volume: Represents daily trade volume, contributing additional context to price movements.
The binary target variable indicates whether the stock price closed higher or lower than the opening price on a given day.

QNN Architecture
The QNN architecture includes:

Angle Embedding: Maps classical stock price data into quantum states.
Strongly Entangling Layers: Three entangling layers are applied to introduce complex relationships between qubits, allowing the QNN to represent intricate dependencies between features.
Circuit Structure: Four qubits with rotation gates (Rx, Ry, Rz) and control gates. This setup enables the model to capture non-linear patterns that are often present in financial time series data.
Implementation
Data Preprocessing:

Clean the dataset by handling missing values and standardizing numerical features.
Encode price movement as a binary variable (1 for an upward trend, 0 for a downward trend).
Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
QNN Construction:

Build a quantum circuit using PennyLane with four qubits and three entangling layers.
Parameterize rotation and control gates based on input features to represent stock price patterns.
Training and Evaluation:

Train the QNN model using the COBYLA optimization algorithm with a mini-batch gradient approach.
Evaluate the model on the test set using metrics like accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.
Results
The QNN model achieved:

Accuracy: 90%
F1 Score: 0.93
These results indicate that QNNs hold promise for financial prediction tasks, as they effectively capture complex relationships within stock data that classical models may miss.

Future Scope
This project sets a foundation for further exploration of QNNs in financial analytics. Future work could involve:

Testing the model on larger datasets and real-time data.
Enhancing scalability and robustness for high-frequency trading applications.
Investigating methods to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
